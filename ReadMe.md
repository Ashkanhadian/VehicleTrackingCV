# VehicleCounter-WIP

A work-in-progress vehicle and object tracking project using Kalman Filter and Hungarian Algorithm.

## Introduction

This project aims to track vehicles crossing a horizontal line and count them. It uses traditional computer vision methods, including the Kalman Filter for prediction and the Hungarian Algorithm for data association. **Note: This project is still under development.**

## Reassembling the Split Files

To reassemble the split video file, use the following command in Git Bash or a similar environment:
```sh
cat part_* > data/vecteezy_out-of-focus-street-traffic-high-angle-view.mov

## Large Video File
